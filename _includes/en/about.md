## Are you game curious?

   <p class="lead">{{ site.title.[page.lang] }} is a series of free public events aimed at creating a space for people who are new to games, or who feel marginalized or excluded by the dominant culture. We meet, play games and talk about them and the issues they explore, like a book club for games!</p>

We will explore digital and non-digital games from an anti-capitalist, anti-colonial, and anti-oppressive perspective, with participation from local grassroots organizations and collectives. So it’s a ~ radical ~ book club for games!

We want to help build bridges between communities, create a welcoming environment for discussion, explore the possibilities of games as a form of political expression, and provide new avenues for people to learn about and get involved in addressing social and environmental issues. Also, we have snacks!

The {{ site.title.[page.lang] }} Collective acknowledges that these events are taking place on the traditional territory of the Kanien’kehá:ka (“Mohawk”). The Kanien’kehá:ka are the keepers of the Eastern Door of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy. The island called “Montreal” is known as Tiotia:ke in the language of the Kanien’kehá:ka, and it has historically been a meeting place for other Indigenous nations. 

The {{ site.title.[page.lang] }} Collective is a working group of [QPIRG-Concordia]({{ site.qpirg }}).

The program is inspired by and has been developed in partnership with the [Toronto Game Curious]({{ site.gcto }}) program, which started in 2013 and is currently organized by the Hand Eye Society and Art Starts. You can find out more about the Toronto program on the [Hand-Eye Society website]({{ site.handeye }})
